description: Ampt integrates with Remix to build full stack applications.
---

You can integrate your Remix application with Ampt and achieve a full stack development experience for your applications. Follow the below steps to integrate your Remix application with Ampt. 

- Install the `@ampt/remix` adapter:

```bash
npm install @ampt/remix
```

or run this when youâ€™re in the interactive shell: 

```bash
install @ampt/remix
```

- Configure remix to write assets to the `static` folder, and the server script to `build/index.js`

```javascript
// remix.config.js
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  ignoredRouteFiles: ['**/.*'],
  appDirectory: 'app',
  assetsBuildDirectory: 'static',
  serverBuildPath: 'build/index.js',
  publicPath: '/'
}
```

- Create `server.mjs` that will be used as the new entry point for your application:

```javascript
// server.mjs
import '@ampt/remix'
```

- You will need to add the dev and build scripts to configure how you start the development server inside interactive shell and how you package your application. You will need to update `package.json`:
    - set `main` to `server.mjs`
    - add `ampt:build` script to run the build
    - add `ampt:dev` script to run the dev server

```javascript
{
  "name": "my-remix-app",
  "main": "server.mjs",
  "scripts": {
    "ampt:build": "remix build",
    "ampt:dev": "remix dev",
  },
  ...
}
```
