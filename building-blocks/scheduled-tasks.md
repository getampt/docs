# Schedulers

Ampt supports setting up scheduled tasks, which you can create using the `schedule` interface of `@ampt/sdk`. Schedulers are particularly useful for:

- Periodic batch calculations
- Periodic checks on the existence or correctness of database records or stored files

You can either use the `.every()` method for having tasks repeat on a regular time interval or you can use the `.cron()` method to have more fine-grained control. You can name the schedulers to identify the resources.

**NOTE**: The name of the schedule can be 64 characters at most.

# **Scheduling tasks with `.every()`**

If you know you need a task to repeat every hour, or every 5 days, you can use the `.every()` method. This method takes two arguments, a **rate expression** and the function you'd like to run.

For example, the following will log "I run every hour!" every hour:

```jsx
import { schedule } from "@ampt/sdk";

schedule("hourly health check").every("1 hour", () => {
  // This code block will run every hour!
  console.log("I run every hour!");
});
```

A **rate expression** consists of a **numeric value** and a **unit**. Valid **units** are `minute`, `minutes`, `hour`, `hours`, `day` and `days`. Maximum frequency is 1 minute.

# **Scheduling tasks with `.cron()`**

If you need more control over your scheduled tasks, you can use the `.cron()` method. This method also takes two arguments, a **cron expression** and the function you'd like to run.

**NOTE**: Ampt uses an extended cron format as opposed to traditional UNIX format.

For example, the following will log "I run on Tuesdays!" every Tuesday at midnight UTC:

```jsx
schedule("Tuesday batch task").cron("0 0 ? * TUE *", () => {
  // This code block will run at midnight on Tuesdays!
  console.log("I run on Tuesdays!");
});
```

**NOTE**: Ampt uses an extended cron format as opposed to traditional UNIX format. **Cron expressions** consist of six required fields:

| Field        | Values          | Wildcards      |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------------- |
| Minutes      | 0-59            | , - \* /       |
| Hours        | 0-23            | , - \* /       |
| Day-of-month | 1-31            | , - \* ? / L W |
| Month        | 1-12 or JAN-DEC | , - \* /       |
| Day-of-week  | 1-7 or SUN-SAT  | , - \* ? L #   |
| Year         | 1970-2199       | , - \* /       |

**Wildcards**

- The , (comma) wildcard includes additional values. In the Month field, JAN,FEB,MAR would include January, February, and March.
- The - (dash) wildcard specifies ranges. In the Day field, 1-15 would include days 1 through 15 of the specified month.
- The _ (asterisk) wildcard includes all values in the field. In the Hours field, _ would include every hour. You cannot use \* in both the Day-of-month and Day-of-week fields. If you use it in one, you must use ? in the other.
- The / (forward slash) wildcard specifies increments. In the Minutes field, you could enter 1/10 to specify every tenth minute, starting from the first minute of the hour (for example, the 11th, 21st, and 31st minute, and so on).
- The ? (question mark) wildcard specifies one or another. In the Day-of-month field you could enter 7 and if you didn't care what day of the week the 7th was, you could enter ? in the Day-of-week field.
- The L wildcard in the Day-of-month or Day-of-week fields specifies the last day of the month or week.
- The W wildcard in the Day-of-month field specifies a weekday. In the Day-of-month field, 3W specifies the weekday closest to the third day of the month.
- The # wildcard in the Day-of-week field specifies a certain instance of the specified day of the week within a month. For example, 3#2 would be the second Tuesday of the month: the 3 refers to Tuesday because it is the third day of each week, and the 2 refers to the second day of that type within the month.

# **Scheduling tasks for an exact date with `.at()` and `.task()`**

Ampt Schedules also supports one-off delayed workloads that can run at specific times, up to one year in the future.

To do this, declare a schedule group with a `.task()` listener. This handler will receive all delayed tasks queued with `.at()` within the schedule group.

For example, queueing future work on a user sign-up:

```javascript
import { schedule } from "@ampt/sdk";
import { data } from "@ampt/data";

const welcomeSchedule = schedule("welcome");
welcomeSchedule.task((event) => {
  const {
    body: { payload },
  } = event;
  // payload = { email: 'user-email' }
});

data.on("created:user:*", async ({ item }) => {
  const inOneHour = new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60).toString();
  await welcomeSchedule.at(inOneHour, { email: item.value.email });
});
```

**Dates passed to `.at()` must be either UTC or ISO string.**

`.task()` handlers receive an event of this type:

```
{
  target: string
  id: string
  name: string
  body: {
    source: 'schedule-task',
    name: 'tasks',
    date: number
    payload: any
  },
  time: number
  delay: number
}
```

# **Timeouts**

By default, scheduled tasks will timeout after 60 seconds. To change the default, you can specify an object as your second parameter with a `timeout` key. Timeouts are specified in milliseconds and must be a positive integer. Scheduled tasks support a maximum timeout of 300 seconds (5 minutes).

```jsx
schedule("two times a day").every("12 hours", { timeout: 300000 }, () => {
  // This will run every 12 hours and timeout after 5 mins!
  console.log("I run every 12 hours!");
});
```
